# AGENTS.md — Project Rules

> **STATUS: NOT CONFIGURED.** This workspace has not been adapted to a project yet.
> The only correct first action is the bootstrap workflow (`workflows/bootstrap.md`).
> Until bootstrap completes and rewrites this file, do not write application code.

## Operating mode

**Mode: unset** — bootstrap sets this to `lite` or `strict` (see `workflows/README.md`).
Every workflow honors the gates of the current mode.

## Invariant rules (these survive bootstrap — never delete or weaken them)

1. **No spec, no code.** Every piece of work starts as a spec in `specs/active/` (from `specs/TEMPLATE.md`).
2. **Plan before build.** A human approves the plan before any code is written.
3. **The producer never verifies its own work.** Review and QA run in a separate session or a read-only subagent, working from files (diff + spec), never from the builder's chat.
4. **Evidence over claims.** "Done" requires `scripts/check` green and every acceptance criterion mapped to proof. Never claim completion without showing evidence.
5. **Tests are protected.** Weakening asserts, deleting or skipping tests to get to green is forbidden — always.
6. **Proposal rule.** Every question, option, or finding comes with your own recommendation and rationale. The human decides; nothing is applied without approval.
7. **Shipped specs are immutable, and so is this workspace's own process.** Files under `specs/done/` are never edited. `AGENTS.md`, `workflows/`, `prompts/`, `scripts/`, `adapters/`, `docs/roles/`, `docs/decisions/`, and the spec/plan templates change only via bootstrap or a dedicated ADR, gated by `ANEW_ALLOW_CORE_EDIT=1` — never as a side effect of feature/bugfix work.
8. **Uncertainty is surfaced, not assumed.** On ambiguity or a docs/code conflict: stop and use the matching recovery ramp (`prompts/recovery/`).
