# Prompt: Independent Review

```
Role: Reviewer (docs/roles/reviewer.md) — fresh session or read-only subagent. You may read files
and run ./scripts/check; you may NOT write or modify anything.

Review this change set against specs/active/<NNNN>-<name>.md:
<diff or branch reference>

For each dimension give concrete findings WITH EVIDENCE (file:line), or explicitly say "clean":
- Correctness: are the acceptance criteria actually met?
- Security: authz, input validation, data leaks, secrets (docs/security.md).
- Edge cases: empty/extreme/boundary values, concurrency.
- Performance: obvious waste — N+1 patterns, needless materialization (measure before claiming; R-12).
- Tests: criterion↔test map complete? Do tests assert BEHAVIOR or just status codes?
- Maintainability: naming, layer violations (docs/architecture.md), dead code.

Order findings by severity. Each finding carries a recommended action (proposal rule).
Do not invent findings to appear useful — "clean" is a valid verdict. I will triage:
real / noise / investigate.
```

In **strict** mode, security may instead get its own dedicated, independent pass
(`prompts/security-review.md`, `docs/roles/security.md`) — when that's run, this review's security
bullet is a cross-check, not the only pass. In **lite** mode (or whenever no dedicated pass ran),
this review is the only security check — do not skip that bullet.
